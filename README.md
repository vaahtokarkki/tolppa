As the official [e-parking.fi](https://eparking.fi) car heater remote control does not provide an essential feature to add a one-off timer, this app will. Please folks at eParking, add the predefined one-off timers, the weekly timer is total waste! Let's hope eParking does not get furious about this small and nice reverse engineering project.
